    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      In his collection of Scottish proverbs from literary texts written before
      1600 Bartlett Jere Whiting has laid a solid foundation for the
      investigation of early Scottish proverbs and has promised a survey of
      later collections. <a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1"
      id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a> The following brief remarks are
      not intended to anticipate his survey but rather to suggest the place of
      this particular collection in the historical development and to point out
      the questions that it raises. Before 1600 men in Scotland had begun to
      make collections of proverbs. A manuscript collection made by Archbishop
      James Beaton (1517-1603) seems to have disappeared, but may survive in a
      form disguised beyond all chance of recognition. Although editions of it
      published in 1610, 1614, and "divers other Years" with "Mr. Fergusson's
      Additions" have been reported, no copies of them have been found. <a
      href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a>
      "Mr. Fergusson" is no doubt David Fergusson (ca. 1525-1598), whose <i>Scottish
      Proverbs</i> was published at Edinburgh in 1641. <a href="#linknote-3"
      name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a> This
      collection presumably includes the earlier gatherings by Beaton and
      Fergusson, but is arranged in a rough alphabetical order that makes it
      impossible to recognize its possible sources. According to Beveridge, it
      contains 911 proverbs.<a href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4"
      id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a> A new edition of 1659 and the
      subsequent editions down to and including that of 1716 announced
      themselves as <i>Nine hundred and fourty Scottish Proverbs</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the edition of 1667, according to Beveridge, "The proverbs are numbered
      to 945; but no doubt there are omissions, as in ... 1692." The edition of
      1692 also runs to 945, "with 14 numbers omitted and one number
      duplicated," making a total of 932, and in the edition of 1706 "a
      fifteenth number is omitted." <a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5"
      id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a> No information about the editions
      of 1709 and 1716 is available. The edition of 1799 was reduced to 577
      items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two manuscripts that were probably written in the first half of the
      seventeenth century belong to the tradition represented by Fergusson's
      collection but differ more or less widely from it in ways that require
      further study. Beveridge, who prints one of these manuscripts in its
      entirety, conjectures that it may "be a much extended version founded upon
      a manuscript copy of [the edition of 1641], no doubt made before the year
      1598, when Fergusson's collection had presumably been completed" (p. xvi).
      However this may be, it contains 1656 proverbs with repetitions and
      changes in alphabetization that make it difficult to determine what has
      been added or perhaps omitted. In preparing Beveridge's materials for
      publication, Bruce Dickins came upon a second "roughly contemporary"
      manuscript containing an unspecified number of proverbs (pp. 126-127). It
      contains some texts found in both the first manuscript and the book of
      1641 and some entirely new texts, and agrees in one instance with the book
      against the manuscript and in another with the manuscript against the
      book. Since only twelve proverbs from this second manuscript are in print,
      any inferences about relationships are risky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The successful career of Fergusson's collection or the manuscripts from
      which it was derived extended even farther than a share in the collections
      already mentioned. In four collections which remain to be discussed we can
      reckon with a close direct or indirect connection with Fergusson's printed
      text. John Ray printed Fergusson's collection in a partially anglicized
      form with minor changes and additions of uncertain origin in <i>A
      Collection of English Proverbs</i> (London, 1670). This book became, after
      several editions, the foundation of the standard modern collections.
      Except for anglicization, "D" in Ray, and Fergusson, 1641, agree exactly
      even to <i>tearm</i> [term] in "Dead and marriage make tearm-day."
      Variations not found in the edition of 1641 like <i>reply</i> for <i>plie</i>
      [plea] in "Na plie is best" and <i>churn</i> for <i>kirne</i> in "Na man
      can seek his marrow in the kirne, sa weill as hee that has been in it
      himself" suggest that Ray may have been following a later edition than
      that of 1641. According to Beveridge (p. xvi), Fergusson's collection also
      appears in <i>A Select Collection of Scots Poems, Chiefly in the Broad
      Buchan Dialect</i> (Edinburgh, 1777, 1785). The two editions are the same,
      except that that of 1777 has no publisher's name and that of 1785 was
      issued by T. Ruddiman and Co. The proverbs come at the end and are paged
      separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Fergusson's collection was the source of both this collection
      bearing the mysterious name Pappity Stampoy and a derivative of it, but
      again with some modifications. Since all the variations except the Latin
      parallel texts that are, according to Beveridge (pp. xxxvii-xxxix),
      characteristic of the edition of Fergusson published in 1692 are present
      in Pappity Stampoy, these variations must have been introduced into one or
      both of the editions of 1649 and 1659. With such information as is at
      present available it is impossible to determine whether Pappity Stampoy's
      rare additions were his own or were also derived, as seems probable, from
      an edition of Fergusson. Such proverbs as "Drunken wife gat ay the drunken
      penny" (Pappity Stampoy, p. 17), "Eat and drink measurely, and defie the
      mediciners" (p. 18), and "Put your hand into the creel, and you will get
      either an adder, or an Eele" (p. 43) do not appear in the 1641 edition,
      but may be present in a later one. In any event, <i>The Oxford Dictionary
      of English Proverbs</i> vouches for the currency of the last two proverbs
      in the sixteenth century. Pappity Stampoy may have followed his source in
      rejecting the "Proverbiale speeches" (Beveridge, pp. 46-50) or may have
      discarded them on his own responsibility. As F. P. Wilson points out, he
      showed ingenuity of a sort. "The thief jumbles the order of the first 81
      proverbs given in Fergusson under the letter A; then, having put his
      reader off the scent, he gives the remaining proverbs under this letter in
      Fergusson's order. Under another letter he may give a run of proverbs in
      reverse order." <a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6"
      id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pappity Stampoy, who was scarcely an honorable man, soon got a Roland for
      his Oliver. As Wilson says, the <i>Adagia Scotica or a Collection of
      Scotch Proverbs and Proverbial Phrases, Collected by R. B. Very Usefull
      and Delightfull</i> (London: Nathaniel Brooke, 1668) "Turns out to be a
      page-for-page reprint ... provided with a new title and the initials of a
      new collector in order (is it unjust to say?) to deceive customers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from its rarity, Pappity Stampoy's little book has both a curious
      interest and a value of its own. Bibliographers have failed to decipher
      the pseudonym, or to identify the printer. Some lucky chance may supply
      the answers to these questions. The collection has some value to a student
      of proverbs for a few scantily recorded texts that have presumably been
      taken from the 1659 edition of Fergusson. Although they do not appear in
      the old standard collections made by Bohn, Apperson, and Hazlitt, Morris
      P. Tilley, who has used R. B.'s collection, has found and pinned them
      down. More interesting and important than such details about the recording
      of proverbs is the publication of Pappity Stampoy's book in London. It is
      therefore an early instance of English interest in Scottish proverbs. R.
      B.'s plagiarism of 1668 is in the same tradition, and so also is John
      Bay's publication of Scottish proverbs in 1670. A selection of 126
      Scottish proverbs, which like the others appears to have been derived from
      Fergusson, may be found in the anonymous <i>Select Proverbs, Italian,
      Spanish, French, English, Scotish, British &amp;c</i>. (London, 1707),
      which is credited to John Mapletoft. It was reprinted with a slight
      variation in title in 1710. F. P. Wilson notes an even better example of
      English interest than these in "[James] Kelly's excellent collection of
      1721 [which] was published in London and was specially designed for
      English readers."

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
